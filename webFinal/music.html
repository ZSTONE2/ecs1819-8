                            The Chicago City Day School (CCDS) was where I attended for my kindergarden through sixth grade years. While going to school at CCDS, I learned the fundamentals of school and subjects like math, language arts, history, and science. We also had fine arts classes like music, art, and drama. I also played for the CCDS basketball and soccer team for two years before I chose to switch schools.

                            The Lane Tech Academic Center (LTAC) is a special program the Lane Tech High School for 7th and 8th graders to take high school level classes in middle school. In my two years at LTAC, I will have earned 10 high school credits that I will get to keep during my 4 years of high school to come following my 8th grade graduation. I have met some great people here and I hope to continue my friendship with them later in school.
