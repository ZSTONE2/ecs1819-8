                            <p>
                                The reason that Revelation 19 is one of my favorite choir songs is because when I was younger in the choir, it was our sub group's tradition to sing this song at the end of every concert. This song has grown to be one of my all time favorited not only because of its history in my group, but because of the harmonies and the upbeat tempo of the song.

                                We sang set it off last year in choir. It was our group's main song that we would sing at all of our concerts. This song quickly became on of the most fun ones because of the choreography that we had to do in order to make the song even more special. My friends and I also like this song because of the very high speed and groovy music and instrumental parts that enhance the song.

                                The Michael Jackson Medely is a song that all 5000 members of the choir did about 2 years ago. This was one of my favorites because I love Michael Jackson and all of his music, so when we sang and danced to it, it was a lot of fun.

                    The Chicago Children's Choir
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Chicago Children's Choir (CCC) is a non-for-profit organization that has a mission of inspiring and changing lives through music. The CCC has singers from all 57 zip codes in Chicago. They accept singers into their many programs regardless of the singer's race, religion, gender, or nationality. The CCC has 4 main levels. The bottom level of the choir is the in-school program. Over 80 schools in the city have one of these programs which allow children to be able to sing as an after school activity. The next level is the neighborhood choir. There are over 10 of these spread in places like Lincoln Park, Engelwood, and Hyde Park. This is where a singer starts developing more advanced skills of music theory and how to sing in parts. The 3rd level is the most special because it is a choir fully made up of 50 7th-9th grade boys that are experiencing voice change. DiMension allows these men to be able to get use to their new vocal range before being advanced to the highest level. The Voice of Chicago choir is a world renound group of about 100 boys and girls. This group has traveled all over the world to places such as South Africa, Italy, and India. This year, they are travelling to Spain. The choir is really cool and I have been honored to be part of it for the past 6 years.

                    This is currently my second year in the DiMension group of the CCC. During my time in this group, I have been able to sing songs with just only men. At first, this was a huge difference for me because before I was in DiMension, I was in a group with only two boys and the rest were girls. This switch was not only frightening, but exciting because I knew I was getting closer to developing my full voice. Last year, we went on tour to Michigan. This year, we are very excited to travel to Alabama for a civil rights tour.
